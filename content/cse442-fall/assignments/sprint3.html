{#== Objectives#}
{#<ul>#}
{#    <li>Implement the majority of the functionality for your project</li>#}
{#    <li>Show performance on an individual basis</li>#}
{#</ul>#}


== Group Points

<p>
    The following 4 points are evaluated on a group basis. All members of the group will share the same score for these
    points.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Point distribution is the same as for Sprint 2 except the version number is "v0.3.0"
</div>

= Group Communication

<p>
    Meeting happened and minutes are in repo for 3+ group meetings, 3 TA meeting, and 1
    Instructor meeting. Miss 1 meeting as a group and this point is gone! At least 1 person needs to show up. Meetings
    also
    must be productive/informative. The meeting notes should be filled out with meaningful information. TA must approve
    minutes from their meetings, but they do not write them. If communication is poor during meetings, team building
    exercises start
</p>

= Group Version Control

<p>
    No group habit of pushing to master or develop. Individuals are punished with the
    next point. If it’s really bad, the group is punished with this point. Basically no attempt at version control
</p>

= Group Task Completion / Version Release

<p>
    Functioning code with more functionality than v0.1.0. If at least
    one group member completed all their tasks and merged them into master then this point is awarded. Tagged in the
    repo as release “v0.2.0"
</p>

= Video

<p>
    Video exists, is descriptive and is under 2 minutes. Link posted in wiki/specific file and format for scraping
</p>

== Individual Points

<p>
    The following 4 points are all evaluated on an individual basis.
</p>

= Individual Communication with the Group

<p>
    (Bail out punishment. If you’re absent or causing your group stress “I’m
    not sure how his tasks are coming along” then you lose this point. Checked via attendance on minutes and feedback
    from
    group/TA/me.
</p>

= Individual Version Control

<p>
    Working on feature branch and merging when complete. Pushing on a regular basis with
    meaningful commit messages. Since there must be regular pushing, this point is not awarded if little/no work is
    complete. Meaningless pushes will also be ignored.. might rename this point.
</p>

= Individual Task Progress

<p>
    Substantial progress has been made on the assigned task(s) for this sprint. If no task
    is assigned in GitHub, this point is a 0.
</p>

= Individual Task Completion

<p>
    Task/feature completed and merged into develop without breaking the project. Can
    potentially get this point without completing the task. The key is keeping the TA and myself posted throughout the
    sprint and document snags in the meeting notes. No chance of getting the point if we don’t hear about it until the
    end
    of the sprint. “Well I tried to get it working at the last minute, but I suck”. If no task is assigned in GitHub,
    this
    point is a 0.
</p>
