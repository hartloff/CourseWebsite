    <ul>
        <li>Ask n people</li>

</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Why write a resume?</h1>
<ul>
    <li>To get an interview</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A great resume can make the interview easier</li>
        <li>Don’t lie on your resume. They can tell in the interview</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning the claimed skills before the interview</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>You’re expected to</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Even if you have the job through a contact</li>
        <li>HR requires a resume to be on file</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Resume Content</h1>

    </ul>
    <li>Your resume is a document that represents you (professionally at least)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This is how you choose to present yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If you sloppily present yourself on a document that you’ve had years to prepare:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>How much do you really care about your career?</li>
        <li>How are you going to represent the company?</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">As opposed to:</h1>
<h2>Make this document look great! Especially if you’re applying for any web/app design or any other front-end design.
    Your resume is a document that represents you (professionally at least). This is how you choose to present yourself.

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Who reads resumes?</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Most common cases</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Software Engineers</li>
        <li>Managers</li>
        <li>Human resources</li>
        <li>An algorithm</li>
    </ul>
    <li>This depends a lot on where you apply</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Add some non-technical flourish for HR</li>
        <li>Talk technical details of projects for SE’s</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Example Resume Flow</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Software Engineers submit a job description to HR</li>
    <ul>
        <li>“We need someone who can work on our website and knows HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript”</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Resumes are submitted to HR</li>
    <li>HR filters resumes not fitting the criteria</li>

        <li>Remember, they might not know what SQL is</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Keywords!</li>

<ul>

    <ul>
        <li>You are busy writing code and tracking down bugs</li>
    </ul>
    <li>You are given a stack of resumes and you’re told to pick a few to interview</li>
    <li>What would you look for?</li>
</ul>

        <li>A few years further in their career</li>
    </ul>
    <li>*Potentially controversial suggestion:</li>
    <li> “Write your resume for you”</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If a company doesn’t like it, it might not have been the best match anyway</li>
        <li>Bad advice if you just want <i>a</i> job</li>
        <li>Better advice if you want your dream job</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">If you don’t know where you want to work</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Try presenting yourself as a person you would hire</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Not what you think the hiring manager will be looking for.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>This way you have the companies self-select as the ones that you want to work for.</li>
        <li>Some things you must tune to the hiring manager (if you know where you want to go).</li>

        <li>Rename the file “cv.pdf” or “resume.pdf” depending on what was asked for</li>
