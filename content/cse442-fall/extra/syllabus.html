== Academic Integrity

<br/>
CSE Department Academic Integrity Policy: <a href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php">http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php</a>

<br/><br/>
Course Academic Integrity Policy: Do not represent work as your own if you did not create it.
<br/><br/>
All violations will be result in:
<br/><br/>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="text-center alert alert-danger">
            <h3 style="color:red">An F in CSE442.</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-8"></div>
</div>
<br/>
It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
have been caught.

<br/><br/>
Examples of acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Searching the Internet for coding help and examples.</li>
    <li>Using libraries in your project.</li>
    <li>Expanding an existing project as your course project.</li>
</ul>


Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Copying a large amount of code into your project without crediting the source.</li>
    <li>Allowing someone outside your group to write code for your project and representing it as the groups
        work.
    </li>
    <li>Violating the licensing agreement of publicly available code.</li>
    <li>Breaking laws.</li>
</ul>

{#== Notes#}
{##}
{#Syllabus#}
{#-Group formation. Default group.#}
{#-No Recitations#}
{#-Communication. Don’t email us, use Slack… how to avoid DM’s?..#}
{#-Most of what I say in this course is advice. I do not want you to simply implement everything I say. This is not CSE250! You are you’re own boss. I am a consultant and PR and resource manager. The TA’s are consultants and resource managers.#}
{#-This course is more like having a job.. except you get to pick you project!#}
{#-You’ve manipulated barnyards in 115. You’ve made a game in 116. You’ve suffered through 250. You may have had 331/241/341/etc. Now it’s time to take everything you’ve learned and apply it to something you care about. This is a celebration of your CSE academic career#}
{#-I assume you know all about coding by now. THIS IS NOT A PROGRAMMING COURSE. This is a project course. That said, you will learn a lot through this course. You will fill in/brush up on any missing programming knowledge. You will learn how to apply your skills on a large project and work in a software engineering group.#}
{#-BANNED: Unity, Unreal, any program that writes most of your code for you. If you don’t understand how your project works, it’s banned. (edit: Maybe not banned, but any non-coding elements will not be counted as tasks. No one gets credit for being an artist or for using the GUI. This alone will discourage use since no one will want to spend so much time creating menus, etc if they get no credit for it. No credit for drawing lines in Unreal diagrams. Also, if you can’t get git working with your project, the team is losing points)#}
{#-The lab and equipment#}
{#-How to fire group member after a sprint. (Majority vote? n-1 vote?) Group size still can’t drop below 3.#}
{#-What to do with fired students (They form a group with each other? They take my bootcamp version of the course?)#}
{#-Can switch groups after each sprint. “Trading season”. All groups must be final by the first Wednesday of the sprint. Group size still can’t drop below 3.#}
{#-Recommend Travis CI#}
{#-Recommend explicit testing. Your final product must work. I will not grade you on your testing, but your group needs to decide how you will handle testing#}
{#-Must use GitHub. Can get free private repo for Monetized projects. Add me as a collaborator and all data pulled for the projects site will be public. Code will be kept private to the group and teaching staff.#}
{#-How to schedule TA/Prof meetings#}
{#-“v0.n.0” is the submission for sprint “n” and if you want versions before the end of the next sprint they start at “v0.n.1”. Versions must be tagged before the deadline#}
{#-Lectures only on Fridays, but I will still attend all lecture times as scheduled. This time will be dictated by the students who show up. I can cover lecture material on-demand, hold “office hours”, discuss projects, just chat, or anything else. I will be available to you. If no one shows up I’ll just sit there picking my nose.#}
{#-There are a lot of individual points to prevent slackers from messing up your grade. Be wary of task dependancies though. If your task depends on a slacker completing their task then you are setting yourself up for failure. Try to setup task to be parallelized.#}
{#-Idea: any grading that is questionable goes to a class vote#}
{#-My job is to remove roadblocks#}
{#--This does not mean I become a developer on your team when you can’t figure something out#}
{#--Though if I have expertise in the problem I might go to the whiteboard and show you how it works#}
{#-List of things it’s ok to do? (http://i.imgur.com/uzw96uj.png)#}
{#-Larger groups means higher expectations#}
{#-Integrity (Don’t steal. Be aware of licenses. etc)#}
{#-Vote for projects at the end of each sprint. Top k get features on the course site and get an extra point#}
{#-It’s very important to chose a project that interest you#}
{#-NEVER email me! We’ll use slack#}
{#-Presentation scheduling#}

== Course Structure

<p>
    This course is focused on producing and deploying functional software and will focus on a semester-long
    group project. The course will take place in a lab
    environment while you work on your project as opposed to a series of traditional lectures.
</p>

== Grading

<br/>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    There is no curve for this course. Letter grades are determined by an absolute scale.
</div>

<p>
    Final letter grades will be determined by the following cutoffs:
</p><br/>

<table class="table table-bordered table-skinny">
    <tr>
        <td>77 - 80</td>
        <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>76</td>
        <td>A-</td>

{#<p>#}
{#    <b>Sprint Videos</b> are short demonstrations of your software that are posted to YouTube. These videos#}
{#    should be made to appeal to a wide audience and should not be very technical nor should they show any#}
{#    code. The specific nature of#}

== Course Description

<p>
    This course will help bridge the gap between academia and industry through the experience of a semester
    long group software project. Students will learn a variety of software engineering concepts and
    realities while functioning as a software development team. Students will also learn the importance of
    continual career development through self-learning.
