== Academic Integrity


CSE Department Academic Integrity Policy: <a
        href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php">
    http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php</a>

<br/><br/>

All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student
or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
be penalized whether they were cheating, or sharing their code with other students so they can cheat. If two
submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students are
in
violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
<br/><br/>
All violations will be result in:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="text-center alert alert-danger">
            <h3 style="color:red">An F in CSE115.</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-8"></div>
</div>
<br/>
It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
have been caught.

<br/><br/>
Examples of acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Discussing an assignment with your classmates and brainstorming abstract solutions, then writing
        code independently.
    </li>
    <li>Searching the Internet for supplementary material on the homework topics.</li>
    <li>Asking the teaching staff for clarification on a homework question.</li>
</ul>


Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Submitting code that you did not write.</li>
    <li>Allowing another student to see your code for an assignment.</li>
    <li>Collaborating with another student to write code together for an assignment.</li>
    <li>Allowing another student to access your code. (Example: Do not host your code in a public
        repository)
    </li>
    <li>Copying a large amount of code found on the Internet into your submission.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you plan on cheating, plan on taking this course again.

== Grading

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    There is no curve for this course. There will be no changes to the grading policies or grade cutoffs
    throughout the semester.
</div>


<p>
    Final letter grades will be determined by the following cutoffs:
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-skinny">
    <tr>
        <td>700+</td>
        <td>A</td>
    </tr>

<div><h4>Concept Comprehension</h4></div>

<p>
    240 points available.
</p>

<p>
    This course is divided into 12 concepts that must be understood. Each concept is worth 20 points and there are a
    variety of ways to show comprehension of a concept. Throughout most of the course, each week will cover one concept.
    This list can be viewed as the course schedule with 2 weeks of flexible time to be used when needed.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Control Flow</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Data Structures</li>
    <li>Files</li>
    <li>Algorithms</li>
    <li>Classes</li>
    <li>Libraries</li>
    <li>Networking</li>
    <li>Javascript Object Notation (JSON)</li>
    <li>Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)</li>
    <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Comprehension of each concept can be shown in 3 different ways. For each concept, choose one of the following
    options to show that you understand the concept.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Lecture (recommended):</b> Each lecture covering part of concept will include some programming questions.
        Submit solutions
        for all questions in a week before each lecture ends to prove comprehension.
    </li>
    <li><b>Problem Set:</b> Complete a problem set outside of class that is due shorty after the week of lectures
        covering the concept. This will contain more coding problems than were given in lecture. This option is for
        those who didn't complete the lecture assignments, or don't own a laptop to bring to class.
    </li>
    <li><b>Late Bloomer Problem Set:</b> Complete a problem set outside of class that is due on the last day of classes.
        This problem set will be more challenging that the weekly problem set to discourage procrastination. Programming
        can be difficult and the
        concepts don't always click within a week of seeing it for the first time. If a concept doesn't make
        sense until weeks or months after it is introduced,
        take this option to show that you understand it by the end of the semester.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    It is expected that everyone in the class will earn all 240 points for concept comprehension.
</p>


<div><h4>Labs</h4></div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">Lab attendance is required.
</div>
<p>
    240 points available.
</p>
<p>
    There will be 13 graded labs throughout the semester each worth 20 points. Your lowest lab grade will be dropped
    making a total of 240 points for labs. In each lab you will be expected to apply the concept from the previous week
    under the supervision of the course staff. Each lab will include a demonstration showing how to apply the concept to
    a real life problem. You will be expected to follow along while coding this demonstration, then apply the concept to
    a different problem independently. The course stall will assist you and answer conceptual questions, but will not
    provide the solutions.
</p>


<div><h4>Homework</h4></div>
<p>
    160 points available.
</p>
<p>
    There will be 4 homework assignments in this course worth 40 points each. These assignments will be completed
    outside of lecture or lab and will involve combining multiple concepts and applying them to solve a specific
    problem. This is where it gets real. You are expected to write a program from scratch that will solve the given
    problem, which is the reason to study computer science. Computers are tools that we use to make ours lives easier.
    Can you use this tool to make your life easier?
</p>

<p>
    Each homework will also contain challenge points. These points are optional and are meant for those seeking an
    additional challenge that exceeds the expectations of the course. To earn these points you may be challenged by the
    course staff to explain your code. If you are unable to convince the staff member that you understand your code
    these points will be revoked.
</p>

<div><h4>Community Points</h4></div>
<p>
    20 points available.
</p>
<p>
    You can earn up to 20 points for participating in the technical community at UB. You'll earn 10 points each for any
    of the following activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Joining a Technical Club:</b> There are a variety of technical clubs here at UB. Most notably in CSE is ACM.
        Get to know your fellow students while earning a few points!
    </li>
    <li><b>Attend a Technical Talk:</b> Throughout the semester the course staff will announce talks that are eligible for
        community points.
    </li>
    <li><b>Attend a Tutorial or Workshop:</b> ACM members, TA's, and other students often hold tutorials on
        topics that don't get the attention they deserve inside the classroom. Tutorials in the past include mobile app
        development, coding interview prep, how to get an internship, and many more.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Each type of activity can be repeated twice to earn 20 points, but total community points are capped at 20.
</p>

<div><h4>Final Exam</h4></div>
<p>
    100 points available.
</p>
<p>
    There will only be one exam in the semester which is scheduled during finals week.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">No late assignments will be accepted. Late submissions will result in a grade
    of 0.
