{#== Real World Description#}
{##}
{#<p>#}
{#    This is Sally:#}
{#</p>#}
{##}
{#<p>#}
{#    Sally is a college freshman adjusting to her new lifestyle. Wanting to limit her student loan debt, Sally is working#}
{#    part-time as a server at local chain restaurant. Sally knows her base pay and expected tip rate, but she is unsure#}
{#    how many hours she needs to work each week and if she has enough free time to work that many hours. She also knows#}
{#    which lifestyle she would like to live and wants to know if that lifestyle is feasible while taking classes.#}
{#</p>#}
{##}
{##}
{#<p>#}
{#    Sally takes her academics seriously and must earn high marks in all her courses. Sally heard during orientation that#}
{#    to do well in her courses she must plan to spend 2 hours working per credit hour per week outside of class time in#}
{#    addition to 1 hour per credit hour per week in class. She believes that if she spends 3 hours per week per credit#}
{#    hour working on her education she can earn the grades she desires.#}
{#</p>#}
{##}
{#<p>#}
{#    Sally would like to run a variety of scenarios to determine which lifestyles are feasible so she can make an#}
{#    informed decision on how to live during her time at college.#}
{#</p>#}
{##}
{#<p>#}
{#    Your task is to write a program where Sally can test different lifestyle choices to determine which are possible and#}
{#    which are not.#}
{#</p>#}

{#<p>#}
{#    She wishes she could just get away.#}
{#</p>#}

{#<p>#}
{#    In this program we will determine if any given lifestyle is feasible for a college student. Our goal is to tell the#}
{#    computer how luxuriously you like to eat, how much time you want to spend sleeping#}
{#    and relaxing, and how much you want to drink and have it tell you if you can afford that lifestyle. To complete the#}
{#    result you will also have to provide you current pay rate and how classes you are taking. The program wil determine#}
{#    if there is enough time for you complete all your coursework and relax with time left to work enough hours to afford#}
{#    you food and drink.#}
{#</p>#}


== Testing

<p>
    You are strongly encouraged to use the main method to test your code. Below is an example for testing the
    maximumCredits method. Autolab will provide 1 test case and expected result for each incorrect question. To help
    you arrive at the correct solution, you should add this test case to your main method so you can check your result
    in eclipse without having to resubmit. When you have the correct output on all known test cases you should resubmit.
</p>

<pre>
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double hourlyPayRate = 10;
        double tipRate = 0.2;
        double dailyFoodCost = 10;
        double dailyBeverageCost = 5;
        int dailySleepAndChill = 16;
        double startingCash = 0;
        double randomSpending = 50;

        int maxCredits = maximumCredits(hourlyPayRate, tipRate, dailyFoodCost, dailyBeverageCost, dailySleepAndChill,
                                        startingCash, randomSpending);
        int expectedResult = 14;
        if(maxCredits == expectedResult){
            System.out.println("Passed the test case!");
        } else{
            System.out.println("The test case did not pass. Try again.");
            System.out.println("The course TAs are always happy to help in office hours.");
        }
    }
