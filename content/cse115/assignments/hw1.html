== Estimated Time: 6 Hours

== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Combine variables, control flow, and functions to create a full program</li>
    <li>Determine if a given college lifestyle is feasible or not</li>
</ul>


== Description

<a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-s17/assessments/homework1eatsleepdrink">Autolab Page</a>

<p>
    In this program we will determine if any given lifestyle is feasible for a college student. Our goal is to tell the
    computer how luxuriously you like to eat, how much time you want to spend sleeping
    and relaxing, and how much you want to drink and have it tell you if you can afford that lifestyle. To complete the
    result you will also have to provide you current pay rate and how classes you are taking. The program wil determine
    if there is enough time for you complete all your coursework and relax with time left to work enough hours to afford
    you food and drink.
</p>


== Questions
<p>
    All question descriptions and point values are provided as comments in the handout file.
</p>

== Testing

<p>
    You are strongly encouraged to use the main method to test your code. Below is an example for testing the
    maximumCredits method. Autolab will provide 1 test case and expected result for each incorrect question. To help
    you arrive at the correct solution, you should add this test case to your main method so you can check your result
    in eclipse without having to resubmit. When you have the correct output on all known test cases you should resubmit.
</p>

<pre>
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double hourlyPayRate = 10;
        double tipRate = 0.2;
        double dailyFoodCost = 10;
        double dailyBeverageCost = 5;
        int dailySleepAndChill = 16;
        double startingCash = 0;
        double randomSpending = 50;

        int maxCredits = maximumCredits(hourlyPayRate, tipRate, dailyFoodCost, dailyBeverageCost, dailySleepAndChill,
                                        startingCash, randomSpending);
        int expectedResult = 14;
        if(maxCredits == expectedResult){
            System.out.println("Passed the test case!");
        } else{
            System.out.println("The test case did not pass. Try again.");
            System.out.println("The course TAs are always happy to help in office hours.");
        }
    }
