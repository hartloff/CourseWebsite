== Movie API

<h3><a href="homeworkCode/hw5.zip">hw5.zip</a></h3>

<h3><a href="homeworkCode/test.py">test code</a></h3>

<h3><a href="homeworkCode/HW5Site.zip">Sample Site</a></h3>

<br/>

<p>
    Download the given code and use it to host your own api on the CSE servers. The given code is a
    skeleton of a web site with API support through CGI calls. You are to complete the functions in
    hw5Server.py to complete parts 1-3.
</p>
<p>
    You will host this API on the CSE servers and will access them through the url
    "http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~&lt;ubit&gt;/cgi-bin/interface.cgi" where &lt;ubit&gt; is the ubit
    of the user whose API you want to access. The proper ubit will be spliced in similar to the ticker in
    hw4.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to all the permissions discussed in lab and lecture, set the permissions of your server
    folder in the homework code to 700.
</p>

<p>
    A sample of a fully implemented API with web front can be found here: <a
        href="http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~hartloff/movieAPI.html">http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~hartloff/movieAPI.html</a>.
    You can use this site throughout development to verify your results.
</p>


== Part 1: Return your movie reviews

<div class="well code-well"><code>
    def handleRequest(request):
</code></div>

<p>
    When a request is made as a dictionary in the form {"request":"getReviews"} you should
    return
    your movie reviews as a JSON string in the form
    {"title":[rating,review],"title2":[rating2,review2],...}.
    This can be done by creating it as a python dictionary and converting it to JSON before returning the
    value. At the top of your file you must add "import json" to import the json library. To convert a
    dictionary name "reviews" into a json string, call "json.dumps(reviews)"
</p>

<p>
    The rating is an integer from 1 to 10 and the review is your opinion of the movie in text. You can
    have as many reviews as you'd like, but you must host at least 3.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    There is no server hosting requirement for this point. Test your code with the provided test.py script
    and submit via the submission site after it passes according to test.py.
</div>




== Part 2: Get favorite movies by ID

<div class="well code-well"><code>
    def handleRequest(request):
</code></div>

<p>
    Using the same function as part 1, implement functionality to handle requests of the form
    "{request:reviewsByID,ID:ubit}" to return a list of the favorite movies of the person with the
    given ubit. Their favorite movie(s) is the one returned by their api with the highest rating. If there
    is a tie for the highest rating, return all movies in the tie for highest rating. Even if there is only
    one top movie, return it in a list and convert it into JSON. If there is one top movie and it is fight
    club, the returned list should look like this: "['fight club']".
</p>
<p>
    API call: "http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~&lt;ubit&gt;/cgi-bin/interface.cgi?request=getReviews".
</p>
<p>
    You will access the requested API through a url of this form. The result will be returned as a JSON
    string which must be converted into a python dictionary. If the JSON result is in a string named
    "result" then you will convert it into a dictionary by calling "json.loads(result)".
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    There is no server hosting requirement for this point. Test your code with the provided test.py script
    and submit via the submission site after it passes according to test.py.
</div>


== Part 3: Aggregate Reviews

<div class="well code-well"><code>
    def getAggregateRatings():
</code></div>
<p>
    Compute the aggregate rating for the entire class and return it as a JSON string in the format
    {"title":[averageRating, numberOfRating,[textReviews]],...} for every title that has been reviewed by
    anyone in the class. Movie titles must match exactly, including being case-sensitive, to be considered
    the same movie. This allows to use the == operator to compare if 2 movies are the same.
</p>
<p>
    This part does not need to be hosted in your API and can work as a stand-alone python script similar to
    the Yahoo Finance queries from HW4.
</p>
<p>
    To obtain the data, you must query everyone's API. A complete list of ubit's enrolled in the class can
    be obtained by calling the API at:
</p>
<p>
    "http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~hartloff/cgi-bin/courseRoster.cgi".
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">This list may change and might not be identical to the class roster so you
    must access the API to get the current list each time this function is called.
</div>

<p>
    The list of ubit's returned by courseRoster.cgi will grow as more students complete part 4 of this
    assignment.
</p>
<p>
    See a sample of the format to be returned for this part <a
        href="http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~hartloff/cgi-bin/interface.cgi?request=getAggregateRatings">here</a>.
</p>


== Part 4: API Hosting

<p>
    Host parts 1 and 2 of this assignment as an API on the CSE servers using the provided code and as
    instructed in lab.
</p>
<p>
    Your API will be called using a url of the form "http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~&lt;ubit&gt;/cgi-bin/interface.cgi?request=getReviews".
    This url is parsed in the interface.cgi file and is passed as a dictionary to the handleRequest
    function. The request variable will be a dictionary where the keys are the url variables and
    the values in the dictionary are the values of the url variable.
</p>
<p>
    Your API is called via "http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~&lt;ubit&gt;/cgi-bin/interface.cgi?request=getReviews"
</p>
<p>
    This will call handleRequest(request) with request={"request":"getReviews"}
</p>

<p>
    Your API is called via "http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~&lt;ubit&gt;/cgi-bin/interface.cgi?request=reviewsByID&ID=ajnenno2"
</p>
<p>
    This will call handleRequest(request) with request={"request":"reviewsByID","ID"="ajnenno2"}
</p>

<p>
    Returning your reviews can be the default
    behavior of the API if any parameters are given that are not in the format of part 2.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    You can also access the interface.cgi file directly to call the underlying API for the site above.
</p>

    will be pushed to hw6.
