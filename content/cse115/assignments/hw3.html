<p>
    Now that Sally has a lot of free time at work, she wants to spend that time listening to music! She wants to listen
    to a new variety of
    music, but she doesn't know where to even start looking. She's decided that she will ask for recommendations from
    like-minded people. She wants to setup a way for these people to share their favorite songs online, but she can't
    find a music review site that fits her needs. Sally setup a web API to help people share ratings. Can you help her
    collect and process music reviews and recommend which
    songs she should check out?
