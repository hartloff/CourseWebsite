<p>
    Thanks to your help, Sally was able to find the right balance between work, school, eating, drinking, sleeping, and
    relaxing and has been hired by a major investing firm. She regularly enjoys her job, but her boss has given her new
    assignment that has her rethinking her career choices. She has been tasked with tracking the effectiveness of all
    the traders at the firm, as well as computed the firms overall return on investment (ROI). While Sally enjoys the
    end goal of this assignment, she dreads sifting through 1000's of trades to generate the interesting numbers.

<p>
    Can you write a program that will process the data automatically so Sally can spend her time on more worthwhile tasks?
