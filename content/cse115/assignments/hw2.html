== Sally's new job

<p>
    Thanks to your help, Sally was able to find the right balance between work, school, eating, drinking, sleeping, and
    relaxing and has been hired by a major investing firm.
</p>
<p>
    She regularly enjoys her job, but her boss has given her new
    assignment that has her rethinking her career choices. She has been tasked with tracking the effectiveness of all
    the traders at the firm, as well as computing the firm's overall return on investment (ROI).
    While Sally enjoys the
    end goal of this assignment, she dreads having to sift through 1000's of trades to generate the interesting numbers.
</p>

<p>
    Can you help Sally write a program that will process the data automatically so Sally can spend her time on more worthwhile
    adventures?
