[Monday - Calling methods (Math, String)]
[Wednesday - Writing methods (explain main method)]
[Friday - Complex functions (multiple parameters. Maybe show some grading code and my main method/why their main is ignored)]

== Functions

{#Slides#}

{#_technically_ you can do anything with what you now know (exaggeration, but not nearly as much as you'd think).#}
{#You have at your disposal what's called a turing complete language, a language that can do anything that can be#}
{#done by any computer. Everything else we will do in this course will be exploring what can be done with this power.#}
{#Much of this will include using code that other people have written.. but how to use their code? They package them in#}
{#methods and we call their code.#}

<p>
    Functions provide a way for us to store lines of code to be used later. The code stored in a function can be reused
    as many times as we'd like making functions a great way to store commonly needed code and using whenever it's
    needed without having to rewrite, or even revisit, the code. Taking this one step further, it also allows us to
    easily share code with others. If someone has shared a function that does what we need, we can use that function
    instead of writing our own code to do the same thing. In this case, we don't even have to think about how to solve
    the problem. We just use the function that is available to us.
</p>

<p>Functions allow us to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reuse code</li>
    <li>Ignore details</li>
    <li>Organize code</li>
    <li>Get more done faster</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>We don't always a function to perform the exact same action every time it's called. For instance, what if we want to
    write a function to compute the cube of any given number. Here we will use parameters (input variables) in the
    function to get the value of the number to cube.</p>
<p>
    A function must be correct on every possible input value.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Return value</h4>
<p>
    Functions can optionally return a value. This value is given back to whomever called the function. In the example
    above, the cube of the input would be returned to the caller.
</p>

{#Reuse functions. Programmers are lazy/efficient.#}
{##}
{#So we can think at a higher level and ignore some details.#}
{#To start a car. Sit down, insert key, turn key.. no. Just start the car#}
{##}
{#Have a piece of code that we often? Put it in a function! Then use it anywhere in your code.#}
{##}
{#Lets you stay focused on writing software without always thinking about how every single piece is working.#}
{#Write it once, use it often.#}
{##}
{#Helps us organize code.#}
{##}
{#Like variables, but stores code instead of a value. Code is inserted into you program inside a separate block when a#}
{#function is called.#}
{##}
{#Must be correct on all inputs#}

== Methods

<p>We are covering the concept of functions, but there are no functions in java! Don't panic, we will still use
    everything we're learning about functions but in java we will apply our knowledge to methods.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Method</b>: A procedure defined within a class.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In java every line of code we write is part of a class, with very few exceptions. Since all our code is contained
    within a class we are writing methods, not functions.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Calling a method</h4>

<p>
    There are many different ways to call a method. We will analyze this common format first.
</p>

<pre>
[variable name] = methodName([arguments]);
</pre>


<ul>
    <li><b>variable name</b>: The variable where the return value of the method will be stored</li>
    <li><b>methodName</b>: The name of the method to be called</li>
    <li><b>arguments</b>: The inputs to the method. The order of the arguments is important.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<pre>
[variable name] = [class].methodName([arguments]);
</pre>
<pre>
[variable name] = [object].methodName([arguments]);
</pre>

<p>
    In this lesson we will call methods that are part of a class (Math) or part of an object (String instance). In
    these cases we will use the dot operator (.) to access the methods of the class/object.
</p>


{#We've been using one method all along. void System.out.println(String text); or just println.#}
{#System.out is called the package.#}


== Math Methods

<p>
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#method_summary">Math Methods</a>
</p>

<p>
    Java provides a variety of methods to perform common mathematical operations contained in the Math class. We will
    see a few example methods below. See the link above for a full reference of methods in the Math class.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Square Root</h4>
<p>
    Math.sqrt(double input) returns the square root of the input double.
</p>
<pre>
    double input = 9.0;
    double result = Math.sqrt(input);
    System.out.println(result);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>3.0</kbd>
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Absolute Value</h4>
<p>
    Math.abs(double input) returns the square root of the input double. The abs method will also work with int,
    long, and float types.
</p>
<pre>
    double input = 9.0;
    double negativeInput = -9.0;
    double result = Math.abs(input);
    double negativeResult = Math.abs(negativeInput);
    System.out.println(result);
    System.out.println(negativeResult);
</pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>9.0<br/>9.0</kbd>


<p>
    Absolute value is useful for distance calculations. Here we compute the distance between two numbers with the same
    result regardless of the order of the subtraction. This allows us to compute distance even if we don't know which
    value is larger.
</p>
<pre>
    double a = 15.0;
    double b = 10.0;
    double distance = Math.abs(a-b);
    double reverseDistance = Math.abs(b-a);
    System.out.println(distance);
    System.out.println(reverseDistance);
</pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>5.0<br/>5.0</kbd>


<hr/>
<h4>Exponentiation</h4>
<p>
    Math.pow(double a, double b) return a raised to the b power. This method takes 2 inputs separated by a comma and
    their order is important.
</p>
<pre>
    double base = 2.0;
    double exponent = 8.0;
    double result = Math.pow(base, exponent);
    System.out.println(result);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>256.0</kbd>
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Random Number Generator (RNG)</h4>

<p>
    Math.random() will return a pseudo-random double between 0.0 and 1.0.
</p>

<pre>
    if(Math.random() > 0.5){
        System.out.println("There is a 50% chance this line will be printed");
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Each time the above is executed there will be a 50% chance that the String value will be printed to the console.
</p>
<p>What if we don't want a value in the range 0.0-1.0? What if we want a value from 0.0-100.0? We'll multiply the
    result!</p>

<pre>
    double randomNumber = Math.random()*100;
    System.out.println("The random value is: " + randomNumber);
</pre>

<p>The output will be a random double between 0.0 and 100.0</p>


== String Methods

<p>
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#method_summary">String Methods</a>
</p>

<p>
    The String methods are slightly different that Math methods in that they are called on a specific instance of a
    String value using the . operator (dot operator). This means we must have a String in our control to use these
    methods. Below are a few common String methods. See the link above for a complete list of String methods.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Length</h4>
<p>
    length() returns the number of characters in the String. This includes spaces and other white space characters.
</p>
<pre>
    String input = "a String";
    int inputLength = input.length();
    System.out.println(inputLength);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>8</kbd>
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Contains</h4>
<p>
    contains(String pattern) returns true if the String contains pattern as a sub string, false otherwise.
</p>
<pre>
    String url = "buffalo.edu";
    System.out.println(url.contains(".com");
    System.out.println(url.contains(".edu");
</pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>false<br/>true</kbd>


<hr/>
<h4>Lower Case</h4>
<p>
    toLowerCase() returns a copy of the String in all lower case letters. Note that this method does not change the
    value of the String itself.
</p>
<pre>
    String input = "STOP YELLING";
    String output = input.toLowerCase();
    System.out.println(input);  // The original value is unchanged
    System.out.println(output); // The method call returns the lowercase String
</pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>STOP YELLING<br/>stop yelling</kbd>

{#-Void with no parameters (I want to print this message whenever called)#}
{#-Void with parameters (Print hello to the parameter) (the hidden lines of code)#}
{#-Non-void with parameters (Simple math method)#}

{#Scope. Parameters don't exist outside the method.#}

{#method stores all the fixed code. Parameters are the only part that might change.#}


{#== Code Style#}
{##}
{#Using methods is essential to writing readable/debuggable code. Large programs that don't use methods are messy.#}
{##}
{#Example code. Identify which parts could benefit from being methods and factor out that code.#}
