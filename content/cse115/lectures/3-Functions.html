[Monday - Calling methods (Math, String)]
[Wednesday - Writing methods (explain main method)]
[Friday - Complex functions (multiple parameters. Maybe show some grading code and my main method/why their main is ignored)]

== Functions

{#Slides#}

_technically_ you can do anything with what you now know (exaggeration, but not nearly as much as you'd think).
You have at your disposal what's called a turing complete language, a language that can do anything that can be
done by any computer. Everything else we will do in this course will be exploring what can be done with this power.
Much of this will include using code that other people have written.. but how to use their code? They package them in
methods and we call their code.

Reuse functions. Programmers are lazy/efficient.

So we can think at a higher level and ignore some details.
To start a car. Sit down, insert key, turn key.. no. Just start the car

Have a piece of code that we often? Put it in a function! Then use it anywhere in your code.

Lets you stay focused on writing software without always thinking about how every single piece is working.
Write it once, use it often.

Helps us organize code.

Like variables, but stores code instead of a value. Code is inserted into you program inside a separate block when a
function is called.



== Methods

<p>We are covering the concept of functions, but there are no functions in java! Don't panic, we will still use
    everything we're learning about functions but in java we will apply our knowledge to methods.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Method</b>: A procedure that is defined within a class.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In java every line of code we write is part of a class (except imports and package declarations). It is not possible
    to define a function since all our code must be defined within a class.
</p>

<p>Calling a method:</p>

<pre>
[variable name] = methodName([arguments]);
</pre>

method stores all the fixed code. Parameters are the only part that might change.

We've been using one method all along. void System.out.println(String text); or just println.
System.out is called the package.

Let's see more methods. Math! [Show the code without method calls by inserting the method code inline.
-abs
-pow

method calls are expressions, or part of an expression, that evaluates to a value of its return type.

methods called on an object (what's an object? Don't worry about it?..)
-String.length();
-String.toLower();

<hr/>
<h4>Random Number Generator (RNG)</h4>

<p>
    Math.random() will return a pseudo-random double between 0.0 and 1.0.
</p>

<pre>
    if(Math.random() > 0.5){
        System.out.println("There is a 50% chance this line will be printed");
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Each time the above is executed there will be a 50% chance that the String value will be printed to the console.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>What if we don't want a value in the range 0.0-1.0? What if we want a value from 0.0-100.0? We'll multiply the
    result!</p>

<pre>
    double randomNumber = Math.random()*100;
    System.out.println("The random value is: " + randomNumber);
</pre>

<p>The output will be a random double between 0.0 and 100.0</p>


== Defining Methods

<pre>
[access] [return type] methodName([parameters]){
  [body]
}
</pre>

<dl>
    <dt>access</dt>
    <dd>Determines how the method can be accessed. We will explore different levels of access when we explore classes.
        For now, we've been using "static" which allows us to call the method without creating an instance of the class
        (object).
    </dd>
    <dt>return type</dt>
    <dd>The type of the variable returned by the method. The method must contain a return statement with a value of
        this type. If the return type is "void" the method doesn't return a value and can omit the return statement.
    </dd>
    <dt>methodName</dt>
    <dd>The name used to call the method.</dd>
    <dt>parameters</dt>
    <dd>Comma-separated list of the methods input variables.</dd>
</dl>



The hidden line of code:
parameters = arguments;

Now let's make our own methods!

-Void with no parameters (I want to print this message whenever called)
-Void with parameters (Print hello to the parameter) (the hidden lines of code)
-Non-void with parameters (Simple math method)
-Multiple parameters. Stress the order.
-Non-void without parameters? Foreshadow getters?

Scope. Parameters don't exist outside the method.




{#== Code Style#}
{##}
{#Using methods is essential to writing readable/debuggable code. Large programs that don't use methods are messy.#}
{##}
{#Example code. Identify which parts could benefit from being methods and factor out that code.#}
