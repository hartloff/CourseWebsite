[Monday - Calling methods (Math, String)]
[Wednesday - Writing methods (explain main method)]
[Friday - Complex functions (multiple parameters. Maybe show some grading code and my main method/why their main is ignored)]

== Encapsulation

_technically_ you can do anything with what you now know (exaggeration, but not nearly as much as you'd think).
You have at your disposal what's called a turing complete language, a language that can do anything that can be
done by any computer. Everything else we will do in this course will be exploring what can be done with this power.
Much of this will include using code that other people have written.. but how to use their code? They package them in
methods and we call their code.

Reuse functions. Programmers are lazy/efficient.

So we can think at a higher level and ignore some details.
To start a car. Sit down, insert key, turn key.. no. Just start the car

Have a piece of code that we often? Put it in a function! Then use it anywhere in your code.

Lets you stay focused on writing software without always thinking about how every single piece is working.
Write it once, use it often.

Helps us organize code.


== Functions

Like variables, but stores code instead of a value. Code is inserted into you program inside a separate block when a
function is called.


[access] [return type] name([parameters]){
  [body]
}

[access] is optional.

[variable name] = functionName([arguments]);

Function stores all the fixed code. Parameters are the only part that might change.

We've been using one function all along. void System.out.println(String text); or just println.
System.out is called the package.

Let's see more functions. Math! [Show the code without function calls by inserting the function code inline.
-abs
-pow

Function calls are expressions, or part of an expression, that evaluates to a value of its return type.

Functions called on an object (what's an object? Don't worry about it?..)
-String.length();
-String.toLower();

The hidden line of code:
parameters = arguments;

Now let's make our own functions!

-Void with no parameters (I want to print this message whenever called)
-Void with parameters (Print hello to the parameter) (the hidden lines of code)
-Non-void with parameters (Simple math function)
-Multiple parameters. Stress the order.
-Non-void without parameters? Foreshadow getters?

Scope. Parameters don't exist outside the function.

== Code Style

Using functions is essential to writing readable/debuggable code. Large programs that don't use functions are messy.

Example code. Identify which parts could benefit from being functions and factor out that code.

You now know how to code! Congrats!
