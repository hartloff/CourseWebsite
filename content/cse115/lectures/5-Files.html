[Monday - Reading files line-by-line and store the Strings in a DataStructure. try/catch]
[Wednesday - Guest lecturer. Time to spin the chamber Boris]
[Friday - Clean up of what wasn't covered between writing files and parsing csv]


== Files

Brief intro

try/catch
arrays
iterating over a file

== File IO

Read/write
<br/>
Persistence

String to int/double

== CSV/Excel

CSV

.. this could be a good place to introduce user objects. Processing sales in a spreadsheet might need multiple values.
Dare we use JSON for such a thing? I think not. Not in Java anyway.


String[] splits = string.split(",");

If you don't wanna mess with arrays for some reason, Arrays.asList()

== Navigating directories

os.walk

Format every file in a directory
<br/>
Aggregate data across multiple files. The first interesting HW assignment.
