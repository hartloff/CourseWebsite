[Monday - Protocols, HTTP, the Internet. All/mostly conceptual. A rare break from coding]
[Wednesday - Back to the code. Introduce the library. Make an HTTP GET request to a web API]
[Friday - Make an HTTP POST request]


{#== The Internet#}
{##}
{#Is great!#}
{#It's the reason why most of us carry tiny computers in our pocket. Computers have revolutionized the world over the #}
{#past 20 years, but they've been around a lot longer than that. They can crunch the hell out of numbers. Companies used #}
{#them to manage and process their data to streamline logistics, but what of the home PC? Word processing and games? #}
{#It wasn't until the Internet became common that the world changed. We can now communicate. Trying going a day without #}
{#Internet. Would you even touch your computer or smart phone? The fundamentals were ok, but let's get connected.#}

{#== The Library#}
{##}
{#We'll use an external library with functions that help us to connect to the Internet.#}
{##}
{#Get HTML from a url#}
{#client-server#}
{#We need an HTTP client in our programs. The most common HTTP client software? Web browsers.#}
{##}
{##}
{##}
{#== Web API's#}
{##}
{#Web content prepared specifically to be used by software.#}
{##}
{#== HTTP GET#}
{##}
{#GET Requests#}
{##}
{#Get a website.#}
{##}

{#    public static String getRequest(String url){#}
{#        String response = "";#}
