== Sequential

ArrayList [and Array(?)]

Must have a type. It's a collection of values of that type.

Elements each have an index. Access data by its index. Indexing starts at 0.
(side note, we can get a char from a String by index. String is an array of char)

add(e)
get(index)
delete(index)

== For-Each Loop

Print all elements in the ArrayList.

Add all these ints.


== Key-Value Store

Map/TreeMap/HashMap

insert/put
get(key)
