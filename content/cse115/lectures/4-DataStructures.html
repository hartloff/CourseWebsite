== Sequential

ArrayList [and Array(?)]

Must have a type. It's a collection of values of that type.

Elements each have an index. Access data by its index. Indexing starts at 0.

add(e)
get(index)
delete(index)

== For-Each Loop

Print all elements in the ArrayList.

Add all these ints.

{#== Set#}
{##}
{#Unordered or TreeSet for sorted (Might not want to get into sorting this early)#}

== Key-Value Store

Map/TreeMap/HashMap

{#== Databases#}
{##}
{#SQL? Too ambitious for transition 1?#}
