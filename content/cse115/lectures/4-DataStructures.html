== Data Structures

When we want to store multiple related values.

Don't know how many we want to store.

Even if we know, what if we need to store 10000 values? Declare 10000 variables all with different names?

== Sequential

ArrayList [and Array(?)]

Must have a type. It's a collection of values of that type.

Elements each have an index. Access data by its index. Indexing starts at 0.
(side note, we can get a char from a String by index. String is an array of char)

add(e)
get(index)
delete(index)

== For-Each Loop

Print all elements in the ArrayList.

Add all these ints.


== Key-Value Store

Map/TreeMap/HashMap

insert/put
get(key)
