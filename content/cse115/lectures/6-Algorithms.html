{# Basic Algo's might be sprinkled throughout earlier lessons #}

[Monday - min/max/average of a DS. Possibly read from a file]
[Wednesday - Linear Search. Binary search]
[Friday - Sorting]


== Basic

Min/max/average

== Search

Linear/binary

Revisit number guessing for binary search.

Give em a taste of O(log(n))

== Sort

Binary search was cool, but we need to be sorted first

{#== A Taste of Trees#}
{##}
{#Mention that TreeSet keeps things sorted for fast lookup (Even mention log(n) for the serious)#}
