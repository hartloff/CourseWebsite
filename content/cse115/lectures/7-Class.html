[This might come sooner]

== Class

Ok.. so what's all this class stuff? What's static? Why are we calling our functions methods? Why does String have a capital S?

A template

Object vs. primitive

Primitive wrapper classes.

== Object

Instance

== Pointers

Remote controls

== Get/Set

Member variables / fields / state

== This

This.doSomething();


== Error Handling

When connecting to your classmate's API's you might get bad data or no response. How do we handle that?

When you can anticipate an error, but want your program to keep running. You can catch the error and write specific
code that handle the situation.

[Might introduce this earlier. Maybe with file IO to catch invalid file names.]
