[The last huge fundamental leap. This one will be tough. It's no mistake that I'm giving you spring break to digest]
[I've been forcing java to act like a functional language, but actually java is build from the ground up to
be object-oriented. This week I will remove that veil and we'll be working with java as intended]
[To students who've used java before, after this week we will be inline with your prior experience]

[Monday - So what is a class anyway? What's an object? Instance variables and state (multiple values in one variable). Non-static method]
[Monday Questions - I provide a class. They create an instance and call it's methods. Not much different from using DS's. Get them used to seeing the Classes code]
[Wednesday -  Non-static methods explained. Constructors]
[Wednesday Questions - Fill in methods/constructors for a class. They're on the other side of the fence from Monday.]
[Friday - Pointers. Putting it all together and driving all the points home.]

[Custom sorting anyone? lol. no time]


{#== Java#}
{##}
{#Java was designed to be object-oriented. I have been forcing it to act like a functional language. We now need to fix#}
{#that.#}
{##}
{#A functional language revolves around functions that are called to accomplish what you need. So why have we been calling#}
{#them methods? And what does static mean? Something has seemed a little... off.#}
{##}
{#What would a non-static method look like? How would it be different from a static method?#}
{##}
{#Looks like we can't call that method.#}
{##}
{#Let's use new to create an instance of our class called an object, just like with did with data structures and Files.#}
{#Now we can call those methods.#}
{##}
{#Let's see instance variables! These can be different for each object. Ain't that neat!#}
{##}
{#Creating this thing and calling setValue is a lot. Constructors to the rescue!#}
{##}
{#Calling an object method from within that object? this.#}
{##}
{#How did I grade that? Know your pointers.#}
{##}
{#[This is a lot. If they survive this they will do just fine.]#}
{##}
{##}
{#== Class#}
{##}
{#Ok.. so what's all this class stuff? What's static? Why are we calling our functions methods? Why does String have a capital S?#}
{##}
{#A class is a template#}
{##}
{#Object vs. primitive#}
{##}
{#Primitive wrapper classes.#}
{##}
{#== Object#}
{##}
{#An object is an instance created from a class template#}
{##}
{#== Pointers#}
{##}
{#Remote controls#}
{##}
{#In the DS PS we saw this:#}
{##}
{#<pre>#}
{#    static void Q2(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; input){#}
{#        // add the String "movie" to the end of the input list#}
{#    }#}
{#</pre>#}
{##}
{#.. how did I grade this?#}
{##}
{#== Get/Set#}
{##}
{#Member variables / fields / state#}
{##}
{#== This#}
{##}
{#this.doSomething();#}


{#== Error Handling#}
{##}
{#[This needs to be introduced in file IO]#}
{##}
{#When connecting to your classmate's API's you might get bad data or no response. How do we handle that?#}
{##}
{#When you can anticipate an error, but want your program to keep running. You can catch the error and write specific#}
{#code that handle the situation.#}
{##}
{#[Might introduce this earlier. Maybe with file IO to catch invalid file names.]#}
