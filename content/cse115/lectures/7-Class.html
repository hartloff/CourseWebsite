[This might come sooner]

== Class

Ok.. so what's all this class stuff? What's static? Why are we calling our functions methods? Why does String have a capital S?

A class is a template

Object vs. primitive

Primitive wrapper classes.

== Object

An object is an instance created from a class template

== Pointers

Remote controls

In the DS PS we saw this:

<pre>
    static void Q2(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; input){
        // add the String "movie" to the end of the input list
    }
</pre>

.. how did I grade this?

== Get/Set

Member variables / fields / state

== This

this.doSomething();


== Error Handling

[This needs to be introduced in file IO]

When connecting to your classmate's API's you might get bad data or no response. How do we handle that?

When you can anticipate an error, but want your program to keep running. You can catch the error and write specific
code that handle the situation.

[Might introduce this earlier. Maybe with file IO to catch invalid file names.]
