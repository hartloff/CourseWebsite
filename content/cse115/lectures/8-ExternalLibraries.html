[Monday - Let's just cool down after covering objects. Plus many of us are probably hung over. Maybe have a review day]
[Wednesday - Importing a jar]
[Friday - Exporting jars. Packages]


== Sharing Code

Many libraries are installed with Java and come with the
language itself. We can freely use these libraries knowing that every user will have the code for the functions being
called in their environment.

What happens when we have a need for a function that doesn't come with Java? Write it ourselves!.. but wait. That seems
tedious AF. There are many developers who have written common functions that don't come with the language and shared
them... for free!! Developers are amazing!

Let's see what this looks like.


== External Libraries

.jar

Add the jar to your project as a library. Then use it! Pretty much that simple.

Give them a simple library so they can get the hang of it before throwing them into HTTP and JSON.

== Sharing Your Code

How to package your code as a jar and share it with others.

== Packages

We've been using the default package. This is NOT something you will do outside a classroom environment (or courses with
other instructors for that matter). We have used default to
reduce silly errors that gives students undeserved 0's from Autolab (Thanks Tom!). We can get away with this with small
single-file programs. In large code bases name conflicts are a real threat. Two devs use the same class name and
everyone is hanging out in the default package? Everything breaks! Import a library and someone on that team used the
same name as you and neither are using packages? Broken program.
