== User Input

Get data from the user. Make a decision based on the input. But how do we ask questions in code?

How to code flow charts.

== Boolean Values

True / False

== If

The if statement

== Boolean Expressions

Greater than, less than, equal.
geq, leq, neq.

== Else

What else?

== Else If

Lots of checking

At most 1 block is executed in a large if.

== Nested Ifs

{
{
{
}
}
}

== Boolean Logic

and or else not

More complex boolean expressions

Truth tables


== RNG

if(random() > 0.5);

== Switch/Case

Might come later, if ever.


== Scope

Variables declared inside the if are destroyed at the end.

== Example: Maze

Ask user which direction to move. Move in that direction.

Provide GUI so they can see the movement



== Motivation

We can skip blocks of code, what if we want to repeat a block.

== While Loops

While

Requires a boolean expression. When it's false, stop the loop.

Similar to an if statement, but keeps executing until the condition is false.

Condition is checked before each iteration. If the condition is false when the loop is first reached it will never execute.

Guessing game. Track number of guesses. While the user hasn't guessed correctly, ask for another guess.
Print number of guesses and correct answer. [Need user input]

Use examples that motivate the syntax of for loops.


== For Loops

For

3 optional expressions.

Syntactical sugar.

Simple format for a very common loop setup.

== Continue and Break

When you want to make an exception.
