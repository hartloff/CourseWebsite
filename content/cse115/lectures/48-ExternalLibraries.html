== Sharing Code

Many libraries are installed with Java and come with the
language itself. We can freely use these libraries knowing that every user will have the code for the functions being
called in their environment.

What happens when we have a need for a function that doesn't come with Java? Write it ourselves!.. but wait. That seems
tedious AF. There are many developers who have written common functions that don't come with the language and shared
them... for free!! Developers are amazing!

Let's see what this looks like.


== External Libraries

.jar

Add the jar to your project as a library. Then use it! Pretty much that simple.

Give them a simple library so they can get the hang of it before throwing them into HTTP and JSON.

== Sharing Your Code

How to package your code as a jar and share it with others.

== Packages?

How in depth should we get with packages and naming conventions?

== Package Management?

Maven or Groovy.

Cleaner and better way to manage all your libraries as the project grows.

Mention these, don't require them.
