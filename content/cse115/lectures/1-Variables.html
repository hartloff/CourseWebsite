== Variables

{% load staticfiles %}

<a href="{% static "courses/115Slides/1-Variables.pptx" %}">Variables Concept Slides</a>

<code>
    int myFirstVariable; // Declare a variable
    myFirstVariable = 7; // Assign a variable
    // int myFirstVariable = 7; // Do it in one line
</code>

[type] [name];
[name] = [value];

Program can have many variables.

Show the debugger. See the current value of each variable.

Variables can have different types.

String hey;
hey = "Hello World!";
System.out.println(hey);

Valid variable names
Camelcase
No keywords

Variable used many times and need to change the value? No worries! Only change the value once in the code.


== Printing to the screen

If want to see the values of our variables.
If we want to talk to the human user.

What are we doing here? Everything you run on your computer is software.
Word processors, spell check, every app on your phone, your operating system, email,
web browsers and the servers that provide sites, the IDE you'll be using, PowerPoint (or whatever I'm using for this).

Software has changed the world and how we interact with it. [Try going 1 day without using any software]

Where did all this software come from? People like you wrote it all. Let's learn how it's done!

But first, we need some fundamentals. We'll start with an empty black box called "the console" where we can display
text. This is where all the software began. and it is where our story will begin.

System.out.println("Hello World!");

We can even do math here.

System.out.println(5+6);

Ok.. so you're not that impressed.. Let's keep going.


== Variable Types

int, boolean, double, String

Let's stick with the for now.

Each variable must have a type. A variable can only contain a value that matches it's type.

A variable is like a container that con only hold a certain type.

== Expressions

int price;
price = 2+2;

-Expressions always evaluate to a single value
-Assignment operator. Left side variable. Right side expression.
-If take an expression that evaluates to a boolean
-A variable where an expression should go gives its value

Order of Operations (At least mention)

== Comments

== Structure

Control flow starts with the main function.

We'll use static functions. These can be called from main which will help you test your submissions locally.
