== Variables

<a href="{% static "courses/115Slides/1-Variables.pptx" %}">Variables Concept Slides</a>
<br/><br/>

Syntax:
<pre>
    int myFirstVariable;
    myFirstVariable = 7;
</pre>
<pre>
    int myFirstVariable = 7;
</pre>

<p>
    Both examples have the same result and follow these three steps
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>int</b> - Create a variable of type int</li>
    <li><b>myFirstVariable</b> - name the variable myFirstVariable</li>
    <li><b>= 7</b> - Store the value 7 in the new variable</li>
</ol>

<br/>
General structure:
<pre>
    [type] [name];
    [name] = [value];
</pre>
<pre>
    [type] [name] = [value];
</pre>
<br/>

<ul>
    <li>A program can have many variables</li>
    <li>Only 1 variable per name</li>
    <li>Names cannot contain spaces. Use camelCase</li>
    <li>Start names with a lowercase letter</li>
</ul>


{#No keywords#}

{#Variable used many times and need to change the value? No worries! Only change the value once in the code.#}


== Variable Types

<p>
    Every variable in java must have a type. A variable can only stores values matching its type.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>int</dt>
    <dd>Stores integer values (whole numbers). Can store values that are negative, positive, or 0.</dd>
    <dt>double</dt>
    <dd>Stores numbers with decimals (ex. 3.1415). Can store values that are negative, positive, or 0. Some precision
        is lost so int is used if only whole numbers are needed.
    </dd>
    <dt>String</dt>
    <dd>Stores text values. Text values must be provided in "double quotes" to be a string(ex. "115" is a String, 115
        is an int).
    </dd>
    <dt>boolean</dt>
    <dd>Can only be true or false. Will be used extensively for control flow.</dd>
</dl>


<p>There are many more variable types in java. We will stick with these 4 for now.</p>

<pre>
    int items = 3;
    double price = 19.95;
    String salesPitch = "Buy one get two free! *additional charges may apply";
    boolean goodDeal = false;
</pre>


== Printing to the console

<ul>
    <li>When you want to communicate with the human user</li>
    <li>Can print any String to the console</li>
    <li>Printing a variable will automatically convert a copy of its value to a String</li>
</ul>

Syntax:
<pre>
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
</pre>

<p>
    Will print <kbd>Hello World!</kbd> to the console.
</p>

<p>
    Printing the value of a variable:
</p>

<pre>
    String hello;
    hello = "Hello World!";
    System.out.println(hello);
</pre>

<p>
    Same output as he previous example.
</p>


{#We can even do math here.#}
{##}
{#System.out.println(5+6);#}
{##}
{#Ok.. so you're not that impressed.. Let's keep going.#}


{#What are we doing here? Everything you run on your computer is software.#}
{#Word processors, spell check, every app on your phone, your operating system, email,#}
{#web browsers and the servers that provide sites, the IDE you'll be using, PowerPoint (or whatever I'm using for this).#}

{#Software has changed the world and how we interact with it. [Try going 1 day without using any software]#}

{#Where did all this software come from? People like you wrote it all. Let's learn how it's done!#}

{#But first, we need some fundamentals. We'll start with an empty black box called "the console" where we can display#}
{#text. This is where all the software began. and it is where our story will begin.#}


== Comments


<pre>
    //
</pre>
<pre>
    /**/
</pre>

<pre>
    int age;

    // This line will be ignored the computer
    /*
      Comments allow us to leave notes for each other in our code.
      The computer will ignore all this text
    */

    age = 18;

    // Comments are used to describe the code
    // The following line displays the value of age to the user
    System.out.println(age);
</pre>

{#== Expressions#}
{##}
{#int price;#}
{#price = 2+2;#}
{##}
{#-Expressions always evaluate to a single value#}
{#-Assignment operator. Left side variable. Right side expression.#}
{#-If take an expression that evaluates to a boolean#}
{#-A variable where an expression should go gives its value#}
{##}
{#Order of Operations (At least mention)#}
{##}

{#Statement. Ends with a semicolon#}

{#== Structure#}
{##}
{#Control flow starts with the main function.#}
{##}
{#We'll use static functions. These can be called from main which will help you test your submissions locally.#}
