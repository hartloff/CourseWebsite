[Monday - Composition (This might be more explanation since we probably used this along the journey).]
[Wednesday - Inheritance (extends). Abstract class. DS of base type (call .sound on a list of animals? Is this cliche at this point? Does it matter for beginners?)]
[Friday - Interfaces. Comparators. Serialization.]

{#A class as a member variable.#}

{#More ways to reuse code.#}

{#Abstract Class vs. Interface#}
{#Extends vs. Implements#}
{##}
{#Can have a DS of abstract type or interface with many different concrete classes. Could have an ArrayList of Objects.#}
{#Though you usually shouldn't.#}
{##}
{##}
{#Overriding equals and hashCode#}
{#Custom sorting of custom objects (Implements Comparator)#}
{##}
{#== Serialization#}
{##}
{#Inherit the Serializable interface. The rest is magic!#}
{##}
{#Only understood by Java. JSON is a good standard to communicate across languages.#}
