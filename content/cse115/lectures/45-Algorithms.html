{# Basic Algo's might be sprinkled throughout earlier lessons #}

== Basic

Min/max/average

== Search

Linear/binary

Revisit number guessing for binary search.

Give em a taste of O(log(n))

== Sort

Binary search was cool, but we need to be sorted first

== A Taste of Trees

Mention that TreeSet keeps things sorted for fast lookup (Even mention log(n) for the serious)


== End of Part 2

Now you know how to work with data!
